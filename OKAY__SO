Alright lesson of the year is that we need to be better with time management, and working better with what we've got...
Basically all the models we have done... I tried to render them in real time on my laptop which is the closest I could get to the computer at the school...
Welllllllll every single one of them crashed... every time I ran them
Since we were running tight on time I just ripped a model, Idle, and Walk animation from a game I found online (creator said use was fine)
So use the file with the really long name for models... still use guns on the HUD and stuff and in the "hand" too just ummmm ignore that it's a spider droid
Alrighty
Good job folks I liked all the models and stuff and we learned some real important things...
